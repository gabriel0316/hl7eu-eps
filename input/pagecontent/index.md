### Scope

Specify a set of rules to be applied to HL7 FHIR to define how to represent a **Patient Summary** in the **European** Context, coherently with the European eHN Guidelines (see the [European eHealth - Key documents](https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/key-documents_en) ).

### Purpose
The goal of this Implementation Guide is to define an European standard for the Patient Summary to facilitate the harmonization among the national initiatives and prepare the ground for the European EHR eXchange Format (E-EHRxF).

This project is promoted by HL7 Europe, but realized in collaboration with several other European and national organizations and projects.

The aspiration of this guide is that of being used as basis for European National Guides, the European EHRxF and - consequently - by MyHealth@EU for the EU cross-border services.
